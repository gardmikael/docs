The response class helps you build a HTTP response.

An instance of the response class is always available in all controller classes. It is also easily made available in [route closures](:base_url:/docs/:version:/routing-and-controllers:routing#basics).

--------------------------------------------------------

### Basics

The ```body``` method allows you to set the response body. This is not normally needed as the framework automatically sets the response body to the return value of your controller/route action. It can however be useful if you want to alter the response body.

	public function afterAction()
	{
		$this->response->body(strtoupper($this->response->getBody()));
	}

The ```getBody``` method returns the response body.

	$responseBody = $this->response->getBody();

The ```type``` method lets you define the response type as well as the response charset. The default response type is ```text/html``` and the default charset is ```UTF-8```. The default charset is defined in your ```app\config\application.php``` config file.

	$this->response->type('application/json');

	// You can also override the default charset

	$this->response->type('application/json', 'iso-8859-1');

The ```getType``` method returns the current response type.

	$responseType = $this->response->getType();

The ```charset``` method lets you set the response charset. The default charset is ```UTF-8```and it is defined in your ```app\config\application.php``` config file.

	$this->response->charset('iso-8859-1');

The ```getCharset``` returns the current response charset.

	$responseCharset = $this->response->getCharset();

The ```status``` method lets you set the response status.

	$this->response->status(404); // Sends the 404 "Not Found" header.

The ```getStatus``` method returns the current status code.

	$responseStatus = $this->response->getStatus();

### Setting cookies

The ```cookie``` method adds a cookie to the response.

	// Sets a cookie that expires when the browser closes

	$this->response->cookie('name', 'value');

	// Sets a cookie that expires after 1 hour

	$this->response->cookie('name', 'value', 3600);

	// You can also set the path, domain, secure and httponly options using the fourth parameter

	$this->response->cookie('name', 'value', 3600, ['path' => '/mydir', 'domain' => '.example.org']);

The ```signedCookie``` method has the same method signature as the ```cookie``` method. The difference is that the cookie will be signed using the application secret defined in the ```app/config/application.php``` config file.

	$this->response->signedCookie('name', 'value');

> The benefit of using signed cookies over regular cookies is that their values can not be tampered with on the client site.

The ```hasCookie``` method returns TRUE if the response has the specified cookie and FALSE if not.

	$hasCookie = $this->response->hasCookie('name');

The ```removeCookie``` method allows you to remove a cookie from the response.

	$this->response->removeCookie('name');

The ```deleteCookie``` method deletes a cookie from the browser. It can be used to delete both normal and signed cookies.

	$this->response->deleteCooke('name');

	// You can also set the path, domain, secure and httponly options using the second parameter

	$this->response->deleteCookie('name', ['path' => '/mydir', 'domain' => '.example.org']);

The ```getCookies``` method returns an array of all the cookies that have been set.

	$responseCookies = $this->response->getCookies();

The ```clearCookies``` method will clear all cookies that have been set.

	$this->response->clearCookies();

--------------------------------------------------------

### Setting headers

The ```header``` method adds a header to your response. The first parameter is the header field while the second is the header value.

	$this->response->header('access-control-allow-origin', '*');

The ```hasHeader``` method returns TRUE if the response has the specified header and FALSE if not.

	$hasHeader = $this->response->hasHeader('access-control-allow-origin'):

The ```removeHeader``` method allows you to remove a previously set header from the response.

	$this->response->removeHeader('access-control-allow-origin');

The ```getHeaders``` method will return an array of all the response headers that have been set.

	$responseHeaders = $this->response->getHeaders();

The ```clearHeaders``` method will clear all response headers that have been set

	$this->response->clearHeaders();

### Caching and compression

You can enable ```ETag``` caching using the ```cache``` method. Doing so can save bandwidth as the response body will only be sent if it has been modified since the last request.

	$this->response->cache();

The ```disableCaching``` method disables ```ETag``` caching if it has been enabled.

	$this->response->disableCaching();

The ```compress``` method enables output compression. This will save you bandwidth in exchange for a slight bump in CPU usage.

	$this->response->compress();

The ```disableCompression``` method disables output compression if it has been enabled.

	$this->response->disableCompression();
